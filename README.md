ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @margery-chuckleberry, a humble pie maker turned code slinger.

Typically found around the oven baking humble pie. Have been known to bake not-so humble pie too on those occasions where I'm feeling frustrated with the world around me.
Lately I've picked up coding and enjoy tapping away *tap tap save* and looking to improve crafts that involve my nurturing hands.
